### Betterment 

> Background

Betterment is an investment companies founded in 2008 that primarily focuses on managing portfolios for retail and professional investors, but also offers checking/savings accounts. It is an alternative to tradional human investor advisors that work in tradtional banks such as Wells Fargo and US Bank using "robo-advisors". Some other compitors in the robo-advisor space includes Personal Capital (founded in 2009) and Wealthfront (founded in 2008). Betterment leads their competitors in funding with ~$275 million raised and manages $22 billion assets as of March 2020.

> Technology & FinTech Uses

Betterment uses computer based algorithmic trading to find the best possible investment decisions rather than human emotional investing. They are considered a FinTech company because they are basically a RoboAdvisor that uses algorithms to allocate and invest individuals money. 

> Strengths & Weaknesses

Ren, Formerly Republic Protocol, is a startup business that has the algorithm to facilitate the trading of large blocks of cryptocurrency with minimal slippage. This allows the market not to increase or decrease the prices. 

The strength:
•	Allow buyer to buy large quantities of market without releasing their trading receipt to the public.
•	Anti-money laundering

Weakness:
The same case of trading receipts not being public could lead to mass criminal activities. 

> Prognosis & Future Outlook

Betterment basically cuts out investment managers and cuts out unreasonably high fees. Their services are at a high requirement with a minimum $100,000 investment. So in the future they are trying to lower the requirement and make their services more accessible to use.
